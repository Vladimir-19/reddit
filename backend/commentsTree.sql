(1, NULL, 'Joe', 'As a solo dev who''s taken up freelancing, Firebase and Supabase both work very well for the kinds of projects I do for clients. There''s really nothing they can''t do since they don''t stop you from combining them with other solutions, and there''s no reason to take on the extra headache of doing everything from scratch if you''re working solo. Firebase is just GCP with an abstraction layer on top - there''s nothing stopping you from spinning up a Node service using Cloud Run for long-running tasks that can''t be deployed as cloud functions, for example. Same goes for Supabase, nothing stopping you from using AWS or other cloud services to supplement what you get for free with it.', '2015-09-01T12:00:00Z', 101, 'https://yt3.googleusercontent.com/GsP5Yvc5jOSop4SJf_75wdOYaEbO-7ZyYhnARodAGRnEMh-OQjGPGzUz2ZtzsHPtqFyHGvmbEtI=s900-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj'),

I can make any number of endpoints and they just do whatever I want to Firebase. If I want to require the user to be signed in to hit an endpoint, I call auth.currentUser.getIdToken() on the client and send that token in the Authorization header of my request, then look for it in the backend.', '2015-09-01T13:25:00Z', 12, ''),

It does help to be aware of cloud ecosystems in general in case you need something that Firebase or Supabase doesn''t provide out of the box, but cases like that don''t pop up too often, and I''ve always been able to slot them into my existing solution rather than needing to scrap everything and start over.', '2015-09-01T13:40:00Z', 11, ''),

With Inertia, React is just the view layer in the monolith, it''s doesn''t feel separate at all. I love working in this stack and will probably start all future projects heavier than a brochure page with it.
